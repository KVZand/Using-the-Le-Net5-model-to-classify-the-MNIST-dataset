# Using-the-Le-Net5-model-to-classify-the-MNIST-dataset

I build the Le-Net5-model to classify the famous MNIST-dataset of handwritten numbers. I also try to find the limitations of the model by feeding it two more extreme cases: 1. the book "Alte Armathur und Ringkunst" by the fencing master Hans Talhofer (1459). The book is especially interesting because at the time it was written arabic numerals were still seen as "esoteric" and were not in common use in Europe. 
2. The "Codex Vigilianus" written in 970 in Spain, which is the first book made in Europe that has, as a note, written arabic numerals that were at that time only known in the islamic world.
